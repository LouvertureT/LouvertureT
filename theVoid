this is where ideas come to die, only the ones that can stand the tests of the void. Can push through and make its way into our world. 

(Theory crafting for pong game)
Structure:
Change the mechanics of pong by making it a coop experience. *is coop mandatory?*
3*6 board | 3x3 per side 3x3 (may need 4 lanes if we use lanes could go with a touhou) | Unsure how to model single player campaign * too reliant on coop aspects needs restucture 
[edit: solution found and updated in gameplay section]*
Goal of the game: Create a coop focused experience that isn't limited to coop, but allows different archetypes to really shine providing a variety of play style for each in
a fast paced bullet hell team-strategy experience

Gameplay:
Structured similar to pong from the perspective of a tennis match with teams of three/four maximum. How to win though? Instead of it being points its more along the lines of a bullet hell* you have the option to return
or dodge but the bullets do return off the wall. [need to decide mechanics for how projectiles and attacks will return from opposite side. thinking about PvE when I mention this.
Possibly rogue lite, with bosses and attacks from NPC's past just projectiles *shockwaves on the ground*] Contact with a projectile is how you lose health. 

Mechanics:

[balance multiplayer by giving 3 relics, the playing characters must split the essense to equip a relic. 
A player can relenquish an essense for another player to have more than one relic.

Introducing rogue lite elements like augments and cards over the course of run could increase playability, and introduce variety. * got to be careful to not stack
all the variety into the RNG. Need to balance RNG with meta progression.

Example Healer progression outside of game can manage and augment the relics you can start with. [should the unlockable starter relics be acquirable in the game, or should 
they not be stackable wihout an essense, should essence be findable mid run?] As the run goes on [level up and augment the abilites you have found in mid room break areas. car]
you will find additional abilites that are class specific to change your playstyle if you desire [maybe when you dont take an ability it can be turned into an essence fragment.]
Ability example 
support>
Abilities: Barrier- Shield a flat amount of damage | Succor ann AoE barrier (Succor Lv 2 equals and aoe barrier 1 same for SuccLv3=AOEBarLv2) | Reflect 
Barrier | Barrier Lv2 / Succor Lv1 | Barrier Lv3 / Succor Lv2 | Reflect / Succor Lv3 
Heal
]

Classes: 

Tank: 

[pong: Can move one space at a time and attack at adjacent blocks.] 
Special Attack Parry - when stanced in front of the projectile [maybe timing blocks instead?] returns projectile at a faster speed than received *note to calibrate max speed with velocity*
Has a single dash to move a space immediately [this is to enable parry plays] Possibility for future improves with either different tank classes or a skill tree to change the playstyle.
[experiment later with rogue light possibilities] 

Damage: Can strike twice and dash twice. [work in progress]

Support: Can mitigate damage, heal, or augment others projectiles
